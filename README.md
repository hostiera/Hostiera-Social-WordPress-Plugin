# Hostiera-Social-WordPress-Plugin
#
#

The PHP code should be added to a PHP file within your WordPress plugin. Here's where you should add each part of the code:

PHP Code (hostiera-social.php):
Create a new PHP file named hostiera-social.php and add the PHP code provided earlier into this file. This file should contain the plugin header comment, the functions for enqueueing styles, adding social media icons, and custom CSS.

CSS Code (fsmi-style.css):
Create a new CSS file named fsmi-style.css. The CSS code provided earlier should be added to this file. This file contains the styles for the floating social media icons.

Once you have created the PHP and CSS files, you'll need to upload them to your WordPress website's plugin directory. Here's how you can do that:

Access Your WordPress Website's Files:
You can access your website's files using an FTP client or a file manager provided by your web hosting provider.

Navigate to the Plugins Directory:
In your WordPress installation directory, navigate to the wp-content/plugins/ directory. This is where all the plugin files are stored.

Upload PHP and CSS Files:
Upload the hostiera-social.php file to the wp-content/plugins/ directory. Additionally, create a new directory named hostiera-social within wp-content/plugins/ and upload the fsmi-style.css file into this directory.

Activate the Plugin:
After uploading the files, log in to your WordPress dashboard and go to the "Plugins" section. You should see the "Hostiera Social" plugin listed. Click on the "Activate" link to activate the plugin.

Check the Website:
Visit your website to see the floating social media icons added to the bottom-right corner of the page.

That's it! You've successfully added the code to your WordPress website. Let me know if you need further assistance!
